# node-bear-api
Today we'll be looking at creating a RESTful API using Node, Express 4 and its Router, and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB instance. We will also be testing our API using Postman in Chrome.

# Application

Handle CRUD for an item (we're going to use bears) <br/>
Have a standard URL (http://example.com/api/bears and http://example.com/api/bears/:bear_id)<br/>
Use the proper HTTP verbs to make it RESTful (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)<br/>
Return JSON data<br/>
Log all requests to the console<br/>
All of this is pretty standard for RESTful APIs. Feel free to switch out bears for anything that you will want to build for your application (users, superheroes, beers, etc).<br/>

Make sure you have Node installed and let's get to it!<br/>
