# node-bear-api
Today we'll be looking at creating a RESTful API using Node, Express 4 and its Router, and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB instance. We will also be testing our API using Postman in Chrome.

# Application

Handle CRUD for an item (we're going to use bears)
Have a standard URL (http://example.com/api/bears and http://example.com/api/bears/:bear_id)
Use the proper HTTP verbs to make it RESTful (ET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)
Return JSON data
Log all requests to the console
All of this is pretty standard for RESTful APIs. Feel free to switch out bears for anything that you will want to build for your application (users, superheroes, beers, etc).

Make sure you have Node installed and let's get to it!
